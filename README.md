# counting-number-of-persons-entering-the-room-using-PIR
We are going to count the number of people entering the room.
We cant use only PIR sensor to count because when the PIR sensor is attached to the wall it will work fine when there is only one person entering
and leaving. But when two people comes then it will think first person enterd and first person leaving.
Hence for this project,we are using 2 PIR sensors and first if PIR_1 gets activated followed by PIR_2 then it means that one person is entering and
when the PIR_2 gets activated followed by PIR_1, it means that the person is leaving.
